what is openCV?
    An openCV is a cross-patform liberary (stands for OPEN SOURCE COMPUTER VISION) using which we can develop real time computer vision application.
    It mainly focus on image processing , video capture and analysis including features like face detection and Object detection.

What is Computer Vision?

    Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.
    From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.
    
    Computer Vision overlaps significiently with the following fields:
        -IMAGE PROCESSING
        -PATTERN RECOGINATION
        -PHOTOGRAMMETRY

Features of OpenCV Library:
    Using OpenCV library, you can âˆ’
        Read and write images
        Capture and save videos
        Process images (filter, transform)
        Perform feature detection
        Detect specific objects such as faces, eyes, cars, in the videos or images.
        Analyze the video, i.e., estimate the motion in it, subtract the background, and track objects in it.
